        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <h3>To make the most out of storytelling in all your communication, you have to start with your master story. It will help you define a consistant and powerful brand story, that's unique to you and that you can apply to each of your speaking opportunity, every step of the way.</h3>
        <h3>When you're done, our Story Toolbox then provides different templates you can apply to your communications tools (website, PR, pitch...), based on the core elements of your brand story.</h3>
        <h3>Ready?</h3>
