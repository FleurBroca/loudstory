# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      mission_statement_content: "I started LoudStory in September 2014, hoping to build a bridge between striving entrepreneurs and storytelling makers. Originally, I had experienced with some friends, also willing to launch a startup, how the impulse of the entrepreneur often comes from looking at things differently and sensing there is a better way to do it. We nourish our ambitions with lofty dreams for weeks or months, but when comes the time for launching, the fantasy can become an obstacle to an efficient communication. There is a time when the vision needs to be articulated in a clear, concise and inspiring way. Being convinced is one thing; convincing the world is another. This is the source of my own dream and venture: to act as a catalyst for aspiring startups and support their determination to write a loud story."
