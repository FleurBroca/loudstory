I discovered storytelling when I was working as a PR consultant a few years ago. Until then, I was trying (hard) to sell company-centric stories. Sometimes, journalists agreed to write about them. But did people actually read these stories? To be honest, I wasn't convinced. I believe the best stories are about the audience. This is what they want to read about. It's time for entrepreneurs to embrace the power of storytelling."
