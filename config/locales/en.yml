      mission_statement_content: "I started LoudStory in September 2014, hoping to build a bridge between striving entrepreneurs and storytelling makers. Originally, I had experienced with some friends, also willing to launch a startup, how the impulse of the entrepreneur often comes from looking at things differently and sensing there is a better way to do it. We nourish our ambitions with lofty dreams for weeks or months, but when comes the time for launching, the fantasy can become an obstacle to an efficient communication. There is a time when the vision needs to be articulated in a clear, concise and inspiring way. Being convinced is one thing; convincing the world is another. This is the source of my own dream and venture: to act as a catalyst for aspiring startups and support their determination to write a loud story."

You're allowed to say 'I hate this guy' or 'I don't know what to write'. As long as you keep writing for 5 minutes. Go! "
